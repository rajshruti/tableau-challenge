Citi Bike Analytics
-----------------------

I analyzed Citi Bikers dataset for Winter of 2018. Analysis was done for the months of January, February and December.

1. Male Bikers Dominate Over Female Bikers in Winter, 2018: First story point clearly shows higher number of points for the male bikers (orange points) as compared to the female bikers (red points).
2. Most Popular Station Among Citi Bikers for Winter, 2018: The tables in my second story point show 'Pershing Square North' station to be the most popular among the riders by a huge margin compared to rest of the stations.
3. 40-50 yrs Age-Group Bikers Take Longest Bike Trips: Bikers in the age group of 40-50 years tend to go on longer bike trips compared to other age groups as their avg. trip duration (at least 1000 seconds) was the highest.
4. Map Showing Most Popular Locations to Start/End Journey: The size of dots on the map in last two story points show the popularity of stations amongst the bikers.
